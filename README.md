# Fresh Eats Project
(in progress)

I created a single page website which included a navigation menu with a How it works, Choose a Plan, View our menu a login and sign up button, I utilized a style tile for the textured background and images, the website is fully responsive, the navigation menu is linked as an anchor div link. I linked to google fonts appropriatly, the buttons have a hover state, I included a footer with copy right symbol and information and contact info, a image gallery of six different images and made sure they are the same dimensions, I was provided with 4 websites for inspiration.
